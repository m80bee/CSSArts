# [CSS Art Gallery](https://m80bee.github.io/CSSArts/index.html)

Welcome to the CSS Art Gallery, a creative exploration of what's possible with just HTML and CSS. This project is a collection of famous artworks and abstract pieces, recreated as dynamic, interactive web-based art without a single line of JavaScript.

## üé® About the Project

The goal of this gallery is to push the boundaries of CSS and showcase its power as an artistic medium. Each piece is crafted to be not just a static image, but a living artwork that responds to user interaction and incorporates animation to bring it to life.

### Core Principles
- **No JavaScript:** All visual rendering and animation is handled by HTML and CSS.
- **Interactive & Dynamic:** Artworks use pseudo-selectors like `:hover` and animations to create an engaging experience.
- **Responsive:** The gallery and artworks are designed to be enjoyable on various screen sizes.
- **Abstract Previews:** The gallery cards themselves are CSS abstractions of the artwork they link to, providing a hint of the style within.

## üñºÔ∏è Current Collection

- **The Great Wave off Kanagawa:** A dynamic interpretation of the iconic woodblock print by Katsushika Hokusai.
- **Abstract Portrait:** A piece inspired by the cubist style of Pablo Picasso.
